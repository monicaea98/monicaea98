# 👋 Hi, I’m Monica Escudero  

🎨 From **Graphic Design** to **Data Analytics**, I’ve always been driven by curiosity — about how things look, how they work, and most of all, what the data behind them says.  

📊 I’m a **Data Analyst** passionate about transforming information into insights that tell stories and guide decisions.  
I love combining **creativity** and **logic**: turning complex datasets into clear, meaningful visualizations that anyone can understand.

### 🧠 What I Work With  
- 🐍 **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)  
- 🗃️ **SQL** for data collection and manipulation  
- 📈 **Tableau & Excel** for dashboards and visualization  
- 📊 Data cleaning, exploratory analysis & A/B testing  

---

### 🚀 What I’ve Been Up To  
- Analyzed **customer behavior patterns** to improve retention strategies  
- Built **interactive dashboards** for business performance tracking  
- Conducted **A/B experiments** to evaluate marketing hypotheses

### 🌍 A Bit More About Me  
I’ve lived and worked in different countries, which taught me adaptability, teamwork, and the value of clear communication.  
Outside of data, you’ll probably find me painting, learning new languages, or traveling to discover new perspectives.
